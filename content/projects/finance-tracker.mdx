## Managing Personal Finances

Managing personal finances can often feel overwhelming, with scattered bank accounts, credit cards, and investment portfolios. Finance Tracker was born out of a need for a unified, clutter-free interface that provides clarity rather than confusion. The goal was to build a tool that not only tracks expenses but offers actionable insights into spending habits.

### The Challenge

The primary challenge was integrating real-time data from various financial institutions while maintaining strict security standards. Users needed a seamless onboarding experience where connecting their accounts felt safe and effortless. Additionally, visualizing complex financial data in a mobile-friendly format required careful consideration of information hierarchy and interaction design.

### The Solution

We utilized the Plaid API for secure banking connections, ensuring that user credentials are never stored on our servers. The frontend was built with React Native to provide a native performance feel across both iOS and Android. For the data visualization, we implemented D3.js to create interactive, responsive charts that allow users to drill down into specific spending categories without losing context.
