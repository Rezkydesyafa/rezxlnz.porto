## Overview

AirLink IoT is a comprehensive dashboard designed to provide real-time control and monitoring capabilities for a smart fan. This project bridges the gap between physical hardware and web interfaces using modern technologies like WebSockets for low-latency communication.

### Features

- Real-time temperature and humidity monitoring
- Remote control of fan speed and oscillation
- Historical data visualization using Recharts

### Architecture

The backend is powered by a Node.js server interacting with the IoT device via MQTT, while the frontend communicates to the server using highly-optimized React components and WebSockets.
