## Overview

Recipe Manager solves the problem of scattered recipes across bookmarks, screenshots, and physical notes. It provides a clean, distraction-free interface for users to input their recipes and categorize them automatically.

### Key Features

1. **Smart Import**: Paste a URL from any popular recipe site to automatically extract ingredients and instructions.
2. **Minimalist Reading Mode**: A distraction-free view that keeps your screen awake while cooking.
3. **Dynamic Scaling**: Automatically adjust ingredient quantities based on the desired number of servings.

### Design Process

The design focuses heavily on typography and negative space. High-quality imagery is heavily featured, but the interface itself recedes into the background to let the content shine.
