### Why Web Performance Matters

In modern web development, performance is not just a secondary feature—it's a critical component of user experience. Below are some best practices for Next.js applications:

1. **Optimize Images:** Always use the `next/image` component to automatically serve optimized formats (like WebP/AVIF) and prevent CLS.
2. **Leverage the App Router:** The new React Server Components architecture drastically reduces client-side JavaScript by streaming component renders securely.
3. **Data Fetching:** Utilize Next.js caching behavior effectively. Cache aggressively for static content and use `revalidate` wisely.

```ts
// Example Server Component Fetch
export default async function Page() {
  const data = await fetch('https://api.vercel.app/blog', { next: { revalidate: 3600 } })
  return <main>...</main>
}
```
