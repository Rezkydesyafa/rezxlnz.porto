WebAssembly (Wasm) was originally designed to run high-performance applications in the browser. But its true potential might lie on the server.

Why use heavy Docker containers when you can spin up a sandboxed Wasm module in under a millisecond?

## The Promise of Wasm on the Server

Containers revolutionized deployment, but they still carry the overhead of an operating system kernel. Wasm abstracts the OS away almost entirely.

- **Instant Cold Starts:** Wasm modules initialize in microseconds.
- **Security:** By default, Wasm executes in a deny-all sandbox.
- **Portability:** Compile once, run anywhere that has a Wasm runtime (like Wasmtime or Wasmer).

## The Missing Link: WASI

The WebAssembly System Interface (WASI) is what allows Wasm to interact with the outside world—accessing filesystems, network sockets, and environment variables—in a secure, capability-based manner.

```rust
// A simple Rust program compiled to Wasm
fn main() {
    println!("Hello from inside the Wasm sandbox!");
}
```

## Conclusion

As cloud providers adopt Wasm for edge computing and serverless functions, we are witnessing a fundamental shift in how applications are distributed and executed.
